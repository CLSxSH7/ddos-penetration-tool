# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The DDoS Penetration Testing Tool follows a modular, layered architecture designed for maintainability, testability, and
extensibility. The architecture separates concerns into distinct modules that can be developed, tested, and modified
independently.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Core Layer

The core layer contains the fundamental logic for conducting simulated DDoS attacks.

**Components:**

- `DDOSClient`: Main attack orchestration class
- `AttackManager` (planned): Advanced attack scheduling and management

**Responsibilities:**

- HTTP request generation and sending
- Thread management for concurrent requests
- Attack statistics tracking
- Protocol handling (HTTP/HTTPS)

### 2. UI Layer

The UI layer handles all user interaction and input validation.

**Components:**

- `menus.py`: Interactive menu system and navigation
- `validators.py`: Input validation and sanitization

**Responsibilities:**

- User interface rendering
- Input collection and validation
- Menu navigation
- Error message presentation

### 3. Utilities Layer

The utilities layer provides common helper functions and services.

**Components:**

- `logger.py`: Logging and audit trail functionality
- `helpers.py`: General-purpose utility functions

**Responsibilities:**

- Logging attack activities
- Configuration management
- Data formatting and processing
- System resource monitoring

### 4. Configuration Layer

The configuration layer manages application settings and parameters.

**Components:**

- `settings.py`: Application configuration values
- Environment-specific configurations

**Responsibilities:**

- Default configuration values
- Configuration validation
- Environment-specific settings

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User interacts with the menu system
2. **Validation**: Input is validated and sanitized
3. **Configuration**: Attack parameters are set
4. **Initialization**: DDOSClient is instantiated with parameters
5. **Execution**: Attack runs in multiple threads
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time logging of request results
7. **Statistics**: Attack metrics are collected and reported
8. **Termination**: Graceful shutdown with summary report

## Threading Model

The tool uses a multi-threaded approach to simulate distributed traffic:

1. **Main Thread**: Handles UI and user interaction
2. **Attack Threads**: Configurable number of worker threads
3. **Thread Coordination**: Central state management for starting/stopping
4. **Resource Sharing**: Thread-safe statistics collection using locks

## Error Handling

The architecture implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, DNS failures
2. **Protocol Errors**: HTTP status code handling
3. **User Errors**: Invalid input validation
4. **System Errors**: Resource limitations, unexpected exceptions

## Extensibility Points

The modular design allows for easy extension:

1. **New Attack Types**: Additional attack classes can be added
2. **Protocols**: Support for other protocols beyond HTTP
3. **Reporting**: Enhanced statistics and reporting modules
4. **Input Methods**: Alternative configuration sources

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
2. **Resource Limits**: Thread and connection limits prevent abuse
3. **Authorization**: Clear warnings about authorized use only
4. **Audit Trail**: Logging capabilities for compliance

## Testing Strategy

The architecture supports multiple testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with mocks
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end attack simulation
3. **Performance Tests**: Load testing of the tool itself
4. **Security Tests**: Validation of safety mechanisms
